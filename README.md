# DAC-weaksurfacelayer
This is a branch of DAC (DivideAndCapture) model that implements a weak surface layer. DAC (Goren et al ., 2014) solves divide location and height based on stream power incision law. This branch is accompanied with a manuscript that has been submitted to EPSL. The preprint is available at ESSOAr (https://www.essoar.org/doi/abs/10.1002/essoar.10511929.1).
